### Review Notes
#### The site replicates the given design very well with some minor inconsistencies to point out. When active, tip does not change to cyan like in design, input field borders shift size when hovering, Number of People input field cannot go below 1 for better or for worse, and second column does not use Space Mono. I was also told that the site isn't quite responsive yet. With all that being said, the general color format was followed very well, the layout with no inputs match the example very closely, the calculation is instant, and the reset button clears all the user inputs and variables. Overall the calculator functons as intended and follows the layout fairly nice.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
